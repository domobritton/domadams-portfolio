        <p className="effect-shine">
          I thrive at the intersection of creativity and tech innovationâ€”
          contributing ideas that are not often explored and are outside the box
          to add value to any project. Working with a team of people from
          diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skills are what excites me most
          about software development. When I am not in front of my mac, I am
          enjoying quality time with my family at the ocean, or on the trail in
          Marin.
